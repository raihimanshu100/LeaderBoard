This is a React-based real-time leaderboard application that updates user rankings and points using Socket.IO and a Node.js + MongoDB backend.

The UI is styled with basic CSS to match the provided reference. I’ve kept the styling elegant and responsive as per your instructions,
but please note that I could further enhance the visual design, responsiveness, and development efficiency by using a utility-first CSS framework like Tailwind CSS. 

However, since the task specifically required using only React and no additional libraries, I’ve followed that guideline. 


Github:- https://github.com/raihimanshu100/LeaderBoard, run npm install after extracting the folder in both the inside folder i.e. server and backend. 
And run both of them in separate bash terminals , 
Client :- npm start 
Server :- node server.js
